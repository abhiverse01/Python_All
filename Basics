# Python is a general-purpose, high-level language.
# General in the sense -> it can be implemented for various general purposes and can be used to implement and solve various specific problems as well.
# High-Level language in the sense -> writing code in this language shall seem like writing English statements, you shall be able to read them and understand them very easily.

#  Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management
and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library.

# Dynamic type system in the sense -> it dynamically shall allocate memory space for variables and you won't have to allocate memory manually for all the variables you declare.
# Object-oriented in the sense -> you can create an object analogous to a real-world object. For example, you can define an object called a car and you can set its attributes; such as no. of tyres = four, colour = red. This is one of the best ways to represent real-world objects and is also very neat and less fuzzy. Right!
# Functional programming in the sense -> you can define functions that can do various specific tasks. 

# Now, Let's make sure you have Python installed in your system. To do that, go to your terminal and write the following code:

# To go to the terminal -> Search for the command prompt after pressing win + R.
# To check for python version ->  python --version

# For setting up a good code editor, you can choose between a wide variety of editors and all of them have various upsides and downsides. Now, If I talk about myself, I started with Python Foundation's most preferred editor; PyCharm. 
# I later switched to VSCode and then mostly preferred the Jupyter notebooks until the Collab became one of my preferred choices. 

# So, the larger point being, you can and should explore these stuff yourself and you will notice the difference yourself after a while. 

# This is it for this session, Let's move to the next session now.
